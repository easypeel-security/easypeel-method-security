You can easily configure method-level security in your
RestController through annotations.

This includes the ability to implement an IP-based ban on
specific methods, which is activated when certain traffic thresholds are reached.

## Quick Start

### 1. MethodBan

```java

@GetMapping("/")
@MethodBan(times = 3, seconds = 10, banSeconds = 1000)
public String hello() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

> Once a user accesses an API `3 times` within `10 seconds`, they are prevented from accessing the
> same API for `1000 banSeconds`.

### 2. Another Feature is Coming Soon!
