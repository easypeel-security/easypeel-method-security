## Code Conventions and Housekeeping

This project follows the style guide specified in `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`.
The guide is enforced in production and test code, and builds will fail if the guide is not
followed. (It is more loosely enforced in test code).

- Configuration files for Intellij users (checkstyle, copyright ... ) exist under `.idea`.
- Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic
  changes).
- Add some Javadocs.
- A few unit tests would help a lot as well - someone has to do it.
- Verification tasks, including tests and Checkstyle, can be executed by running ./gradlew check
  from the project root.

## For your first contribution

- Run all tests (including style checks)

```bash
./gradlew check
```

- Deploy to local maven repository

Run the following command to deploy the library to your local maven repository

```bash
./gradlew publishMavenPublicationToMavenLocal
```

and then add the following to your `build.gradle` file (for test locally)

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenLocal() // add this line
    // ...
}
```

<!--

## For maintainers

```bash
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralUsername=""
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralPassword=""
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKey=""
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyId=""
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyPassword=""
```

- Deploy to maven central manually

```bash
./gradlew publishMavenPublicationToMavenCentralRepository -PRELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED=true
```
